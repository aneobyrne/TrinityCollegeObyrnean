## Overview
**LunarRover04** is the client-side software responsible for handling communication between the lunar rover and Earth. It connects to a designated ground station via a structured protocol, supporting five key interactions:

1. **Movement Control** - Receives and executes movement commands.
2. **Telemetry Transmission** - Sends rover status data.
3. **Temperature Data Logging** - Transfers temperature readings to Earth.
4. **Error Simulation** - Enables fault testing and diagnostics.
5. **Rover Discovery** - Searches for nearby rovers to establish connections.
